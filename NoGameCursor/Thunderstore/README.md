# NoGameCursor
This mod is based on [ACPs](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/ACP/NoGameCursor/) mod that stopped working for me after the Gloomrot update.

A mod that change the game cursor to fit your operating system cursor.

<details>

*_Q:_* Why would you want to hide the game cursor?<br>
*_A:_* Well, in a game that heavily relies on the mouse location for aiming, 
you need to make sure to be able to see the cursor at any time. 
Unfortunaltely the pace of the game and the fast changing graphics often make 
you lose track of the current mouse location.
Further more the game cursor is fix and can't be customized by the game, but 
the desktop cursor can. 
With this mod you can disable the game cursor and use any customized Windows 
cursor or even use tools like YoloMouse.

*_Disclaimer:_* I am *NOT* affiliated at any means with YoloMouse! I haven't 
programmed it, I don't earn anything from it, I am just a happy user of that
tool for quite some years now, especially in heavy graphic mouse location 
dependend games like VRising or Path of Exile.

*_Q:_* What is Yolomouse?<br>
*_A:_* Yolomouse is a tool to switch the mouse cursor based on the application currently 
running in foreground. This allows you to have different mouse cursor designs 
which are only visible if you really use the configured application.
You could therefore have a really huge cursor that you will never ever lose 
track only while playing a certain game, e.g. VRising.

*_Q:_* I am hooked. Where can I get YoloMouse?<br>
*_A:_* The newest version can be downloaded from [here](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/).
Personally I recommend the fully working older version 0.11.3 since it is free 
of charge, which you can download [here](https://github.com/PandaTeemo/YoloMouse/releases/download/0.11.3/YoloMouse64.msi).

Actually I only do it for mods I am using on my own server.
